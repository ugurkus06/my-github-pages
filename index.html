    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p> Hey there! My name is Uğur Kuş. I am a 3rd year student in <i>Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt University</i>,<i>Computer Engineering Department</i> .
    </p>     
    
    <p>    
        I'm passionate about software development and also eager
        to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        I love <b>problem solving, collaborating with others,
        and diving into new technologies.</b>
    </p>
        
    <p>
        I'm well-versed in <b>software development processes,
        object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, 
        and database management.</b> 
    </p>
    
    <p>   
        But more than just writing code, 
        I enjoy the challenge of <i>turning ideas into functional, efficient solutions.</i> 
        I'm excited to <i>keep learning, building, and improving!</i>
    </p>
